# Research Protocol: Temperature Variation Study

## 1. Study Overview
This document outlines the protocol for the temperature variation study conducted in May 2024. The study aims to analyze diurnal temperature patterns under controlled conditions.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Equipment
- Digital thermometer (Model: DTM-123)
- Data logger (Model: DL-2000)
- Weather station (Model: WS-1000)

### 2.2 Data Collection
1. Measurements taken at 15-minute intervals
2. Duration: 24-hour period
3. Location: Research Lab 3, Building B
4. Calibration performed before and after data collection

### 2.3 Variables
- Temperature (Â°C)
- Timestamp
- Measurement variation
- Environmental conditions

## 3. Data Analysis
- Statistical analysis using Python (pandas, numpy)
- Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Outlier detection and handling

## 4. Quality Control
- Regular equipment calibration
- Duplicate measurements
- Automated data validation

## 5. Expected Outcomes
- Diurnal temperature profile
- Variation patterns
- Statistical summaries
