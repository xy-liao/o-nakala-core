## Documentation Philosophy

### **O-Nakala Core vs Official NAKALA Docs**

**Important**: O-Nakala Core uses **user-friendly CSV formats** that differ from the official NAKALA API. This is intentional design for ease of use.

| Format | Official NAKALA API | O-Nakala Core |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Creators** | `[{"givenname": "Jean", "surname": "Dupont"}]` | `"Dupont,Jean"` |
| **Multilingual** | Multiple API calls | `"fr:Titre\|en:Title"` |
| **Why Different?** | Raw API power | User-friendly simplicity |

**You get both**: Simple CSV input **AND** full API compliance through automatic conversion.

### User-Focused vs Demo Content

**User Guides** (what you need to accomplish your work):
- Action-oriented language ("Upload your data", "Improve metadata")
- Practical time estimates and clear outcomes
- Progressive disclosure (quick start â†’ detailed options)
- Troubleshooting and real-world tips

**Demo Content** (exploring what's possible):
- Feature-oriented language ("Demonstrates ML capabilities")
- Technical details and integration points exposed
- Comprehensive capability showcase
- Development and evaluation focus

Both types serve important but different purposes. User guides help you get work done; demos help you understand what's available.
